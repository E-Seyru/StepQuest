        Debug.Log($"OfflineCombatSimulator: Simulating {duration.TotalMinutes} mins in {zoneId} (Placeholder)");

        // --- Simulation Setup ---
        // TODO: Load monster pool for the zoneId
        // TODO: Get player's relevant stats and abilities from playerStartState
        // TODO: Get looping rules (e.g., HP% threshold to use potions)

        // --- Simulation Core Logic ---
        // This is the complex part. Needs a simplified model of combat.
        // Approach 1: Average Time Per Fight
        //      - Estimate average time to win/lose one fight based on player vs average monster stats.
        //      - Calculate number of fights possible in 'duration'.
        //      - Simulate each fight sequentially (or in batches):
        //          - Calculate expected damage dealt/taken per second/turn.
        //          - Check if potions are used based on rules.
        //          - Determine fight outcome (win/loss).
        //          - Accumulate rewards (XP, loot) for wins.
        //          - Stop if player runs out of potions and HP drops too low (KO'd).
        // Approach 2: Rate-Based Simulation
        //      - Calculate player DPS, monster average DPS, player HPS (healing per second), etc.
        //      - Calculate average kill rate and average death rate (considering potions).
        //      - Project results over the duration, accounting for resource depletion (potions).
        // Need to be careful about performance - avoid simulating every single attack.

        // --- Risk-Aware Aspect ---
        // TODO: Factor in randomness/variance (critical hits, misses - maybe simplified).
        // TODO: Model the risk of running out of potions.
        // TODO: Model the risk of encountering a particularly strong monster combination.
        // TODO: Ensure the simulation doesn't grant rewards if the player would likely have been defeated early on.

        // --- Result Aggregation ---
        // TODO: Tally total fights, wins, losses.
        // TODO: Tally total XP, currency, loot (use monster loot tables).
        // TODO: Calculate potions used.
        // TODO: Determine player's final HP state (or if KO'd).

        // TODO: Create and return OfflineCombatSummary object.
        return new OfflineCombatSummary
