# Instructions for Integrating TravelProgressUI in Unity Editor

This guide outlines the steps to connect the `TravelProgressUI.cs` script with the pre-designed UI elements in your Unity scene.

**Prerequisites:**

*   The `TravelProgressUI.cs` script is located in your project at `Assets/Scripts/UI/Panels/`.
*   You have already created the following UI GameObjects in your Unity scene hierarchy:
    *   `TravelProgressPanel` (this will be the root panel GameObject)
    *   `StatusText` (a TextMeshProUGUI element for status messages)
    *   `DestinationNameText` (a TextMeshProUGUI element for the destination's name)
    *   `TravelProgressBar` (a Slider element for the progress bar)
    *   `StepsProgressText` (a TextMeshProUGUI element for showing step progression)

**Steps to Follow in the Unity Editor:**

1.  **Select the `TravelProgressPanel` GameObject:**
    *   In the Unity Editor's **Hierarchy** window, find the `TravelProgressPanel` GameObject that you created.
    *   Click on `TravelProgressPanel` to select it.

2.  **Attach the `TravelProgressUI.cs` Script:**
    *   With the `TravelProgressPanel` GameObject selected, look at the **Inspector** window.
    *   At the bottom of the Inspector window, click the **"Add Component"** button.
    *   A search box will appear. Type "TravelProgressUI" into the search box.
    *   Select the `TravelProgressUI` script from the search results to add it as a component to the `TravelProgressPanel`.

3.  **Assign UI Elements to the Script's Public Fields:**
    *   After adding the `TravelProgressUI` script, its public fields will be visible in the Inspector window under the "Travel Progress UI (Script)" component section.
    *   You need to link your UI GameObjects to these fields. To do this, drag each corresponding GameObject from the **Hierarchy** window and drop it onto its respective slot in the **Inspector**:

        *   **Travel Progress Panel Root:**
            *   Drag the `TravelProgressPanel` GameObject (the one you selected in step 1) from the Hierarchy onto this slot.
        *   **Travel Progress Bar:**
            *   Drag your `TravelProgressBar` (Slider) GameObject from the Hierarchy onto this slot.
        *   **Destination Name Text:**
            *   Drag your `DestinationNameText` (TextMeshProUGUI) GameObject from the Hierarchy onto this slot.
        *   **Steps Progress Text:**
            *   Drag your `StepsProgressText` (TextMeshProUGUI) GameObject from the Hierarchy onto this slot.
        *   **Status Message Text:**
            *   Drag your `StatusText` (TextMeshProUGUI) GameObject from the Hierarchy onto this slot.

4.  **Verify Assignments:**
    *   Carefully review each field in the `TravelProgressUI` component section in the Inspector.
    *   Ensure that each slot has the correct GameObject assigned to it. There should be no "None (Type)" messages for these fields if assigned correctly.

**Outcome:**

Once these steps are completed, the `TravelProgressUI.cs` script will be properly connected to its corresponding UI elements. This will enable the script to manage and update the travel progress display in your game according to events triggered by the `MapManager`.
