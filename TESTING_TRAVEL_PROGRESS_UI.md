# Testing the Travel Progress UI in Unity

This guide outlines the steps to test the new Travel Progress UI functionality within your Unity project.

**Prerequisites:**

1.  The `TravelProgressUI.cs` script (located at `Assets/Scripts/UI/Panels/`) is complete and error-free.
2.  You have created the necessary UI elements in your Unity scene for the travel progress display (e.g., a root panel named `TravelProgressPanel`, TextMeshProUGUI elements for status, destination name, and steps, and a Slider for the progress bar).
3.  The `TravelProgressUI.cs` script is attached as a component to the `TravelProgressPanel` GameObject.
4.  All public UI element references (e.g., `travelProgressBar`, `destinationNameText`) in the `TravelProgressUI` script component (viewable in the Inspector when `TravelProgressPanel` is selected) have been correctly assigned by dragging and dropping the corresponding UI elements from your scene hierarchy.
5.  The `TravelProgressPanel` is initially hidden. This can be achieved by:
    *   Deactivating the `TravelProgressPanel` GameObject itself.
    *   Or, if using a `CanvasGroup` component on the `TravelProgressPanel`, setting its `Alpha` to 0 and ensuring `Interactable` and `Blocks Raycasts` are unchecked. The `TravelProgressUI.cs` script will manage its visibility based on travel state.
6.  Your game has a functional `MapManager` that can initiate travel between locations and trigger the `OnTravelStarted`, `OnTravelProgress`, and `OnTravelCompleted` events.

**Testing Steps:**

1.  **Open Project and Scene:**
    *   Launch the Unity Editor and open your project.
    *   Open the scene that contains the `TravelProgressPanel` and the game mechanics for initiating travel.

2.  **Run the Game:**
    *   In the Unity Editor, click the **Play** button (the triangle icon at the top).

3.  **Initiate Travel:**
    *   Using your game's interface, start a journey from one location to another. This could be clicking a button on a world map, selecting a destination from a UI list, or any other method your game uses.
    *   **Expected Behavior:** As soon as travel begins (i.e., `MapManager.OnTravelStarted` is invoked), the `TravelProgressPanel` should become visible on the screen.
    *   **Verification Points:**
        *   **Status Message:** Check if the `statusMessageText` UI element displays a message like "Traveling to...".
        *   **Destination Name:** Confirm that `destinationNameText` shows the correct name of the location you are traveling to.
        *   **Steps Progress:** Verify that `stepsProgressText` shows the initial state, for example, "0 / [TotalSteps] steps" (where `[TotalSteps]` is the number of steps required for the journey).
        *   **Progress Bar:** Ensure the `travelProgressBar` Slider is at its minimum value (0% filled).

4.  **Simulate Step Progress:**
    *   Perform actions in your game that cause travel progress. This might involve:
        *   Moving your character if your game tracks actual movement steps.
        *   Using a debug command or button (if you've implemented one) to increment travel steps manually.
    *   The `MapManager` should be processing these steps and triggering the `OnTravelProgress` event.
    *   **Expected Behavior:** The UI elements related to progress should update dynamically.
    *   **Verification Points:**
        *   **Steps Text Update:** Observe if `stepsProgressText` accurately reflects the current number of steps taken versus the total required (e.g., "50 / 500 steps").
        *   **Progress Bar Update:** Check that the `travelProgressBar`'s fill amount increases in proportion to the steps taken.
        *   Confirm that `travelProgressBar.maxValue` was correctly set by the `HandleTravelStarted` method to the total required steps for the current journey.

5.  **Complete Travel:**
    *   Continue to accumulate travel steps until the `currentSteps` equals `requiredSteps`.
    *   **Expected Behavior:** Once travel is complete (i.e., `MapManager.OnTravelCompleted` is invoked), the `TravelProgressPanel` should automatically hide and no longer be visible.
    *   **Verification Points:**
        *   Confirm that the `TravelProgressPanel` (and all its child UI elements) is no longer visible.

6.  **(Optional) Test Multiple Travels:**
    *   If your game allows, initiate a new journey to a different location.
    *   Verify that the `TravelProgressPanel` reappears and displays the correct information (destination name, required steps) for this new journey and updates progress accurately.

7.  **(Optional) Test Edge Cases (If Applicable):**
    *   **Travel Cancellation:**
        *   If your game implements a feature to cancel ongoing travel, test this scenario.
        *   **Note:** The current `TravelProgressUI.cs` script only hides the panel upon `OnTravelCompleted`. If travel cancellation requires specific UI behavior (e.g., immediate hiding, a "Cancelled" message), you would need to modify `TravelProgressUI.cs` to subscribe to a relevant event from `MapManager` (e.g., `OnTravelCancelled`) and implement the desired logic.
    *   **Instantaneous Travel:**
        *   If your game allows for travel that requires zero steps (instantaneous travel), observe how the UI behaves.
        *   Ideally, the UI might briefly flash or not appear at all. Check that it doesn't get stuck in a visible state.

8.  **Check Console Logs:**
    *   Throughout your testing, keep the Unity **Console window** (Window > General > Console) visible.
    *   Monitor for any error messages or warnings.
    *   Review the debug logs generated by `TravelProgressUI.cs` (e.g., "Travel started to...", "Progress update...", "Travel completed...") to understand the script's state and event handling. These logs can be very helpful for troubleshooting.

**Successful Outcome:**

If all tests pass, you've successfully confirmed that the Travel Progress UI:
*   Appears correctly when travel begins.
*   Displays accurate destination and progress information.
*   Updates dynamically as travel progresses.
*   Disappears appropriately when travel is completed.

This indicates a successful integration of the `TravelProgressUI` system.The instructions for testing the Travel Progress UI have been created and saved to `TESTING_TRAVEL_PROGRESS_UI.md`. This fulfills the requirements of the subtask.
